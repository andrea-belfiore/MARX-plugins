# MARX-plugins
Some plugins for simulating Chandra sources with MARX

The first plugin in the list is Draine_halo.c, used in Belfiore et al. 2019
to simulate an X-ray dust scattering halo around NGC 5907 ULX-1.
The source geometry is based on X-ray scattering halo approximations from
Draine, 2003, ApJ 598, 1023.
Instructions on how to compile and use the plugin appear as header comments
in the source code 'Draine_halo.c'
